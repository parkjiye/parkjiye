### Hi there 👋

My name is Jiye Park and I am 23 years old. I live in Suwon, South Korea.

These days, I’m looking for a job as a computer engineer. I’d like to work in this field because I studied computer science in university, and I’m pretty good at it such as web programming and application development. 

Now that my university education has finished, I’m looking forward to starting my career.

My hobbies these days include watching sports game ⚾ 🏐 and playing computer games 🎮.

### 🦾 Programming Skills
